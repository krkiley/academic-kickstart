As a postdoctoral teaching scholar at NC State University, I teach graduate and undergraduate courses in methods, theory, and religion, as well as an introductory sociology course. 

#### SOC 309: Classical Sociological Theory (NCSU Fall 2023)

<em>Instructor</em>

Graduate-level seminar on the classical works in sociological theory, including Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Simmel, and Mead. The course emphasizes the theoretical perspectives that underpin classical works to provide students with a "theoretical toolkit" to theorize social phenomena and understand contempoary work.

#### SOC 309: Religion and Society (NCSU Fall 2023, Spring 2024)

<em>Instructor</em>

Introduction to the sociological approach to studying religion, with a particular emphasis on religion in the United States. During the course, students learn about the religious diversity of the United States, patterns of religious change over the life course, the organizaiton of religion, and the association between religion and other forms of social division. As part of the class, students learn to conduct fieldwork by visiting and observing local religious organizations. 

#### SOC 300: Methods of Social Science Research (NCSU Spring 2022)

<em>Instructor</em>

An in-depth survey of research methods in the social science, including survey research, participant observation, interviewing, and computational approaches. Throughout the course, students design and condust original research on a topic of their choosing. Laboratory sections introduce students to statistical programming tools. 

#### SOC 202: Principles of Sociology (NCSU Fall 2022)

<em>Instructor</em>

An introduction to the principles and methods of sociology. Introduces students to the "sociological imagination," stuctural and cultural explanations of social phenomena, and inequalities in contemporary society.  

#### SOCIOL 333: Quantiative Analysis of Sociological Data (Duke Summer 2020)

<em>Instructor</em>

This course serves to introduce undergraduate sociology majors to quantitative approaches in the social science. Topics include probability and statistics, sampling and inference, linear and multiple regression, and writing about quantiative results. Over the course of the class, students designed a research project, outlined testable hypotheses, found relevant data sources, and conducted analyses.  

#### SOCIOL 722: Graduate Statistics I (Duke Fall 2017, 2019, 2020)

<em>Lab instructor</em>

This course is the first in a two-semester sequence in statistical methods required for all first-year graduate students in the sociology department. The course covers probability and statistics, hypothesis testing, linear regression, multiple regression, maximum likelihood estimation, generalized linear models, model disagnostics, and model selection. As lab instructor, I led a two-and-a-half hour section that reinforced and extended the main topics of the course, instructed students in statistical software, and highlighted topics not covered in the main lectures.

#### SOCIOL 723: Graduate Statistics II (Duke Spring 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021)

<em>Lab instructor</em>

This course is the second of a two-semester sequence for first-year graduate students. Topics included causal inference, matching and weighting, instrumental variables, panel data, multi-level models, and Bayesian approaches. As lab instructor, I led a two-and-a-half hour section that reinforced and extended the main topics of the course, instructed students in statistical software, and highlighted topics not covered in the main lectures.
