Hello! I am Kevin Kiley. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Sociology and Anthropology at North Carolina State University](https://socant.chass.ncsu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in sociology in 2021 from [Duke University](https://sociology.duke.edu/). Here is my [CV](https://krkiley.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

I am a political and cultural sociologist with interests in quantitative and computational methods. My work explores the sources of stability and change in political preferences and personal culture over the life course and tries to make sense of individual inconsistency in opinions and tastes over time. Across this work I refine theories of opinion holding and cultural internalization by focusing on the interaction of human cognition with the “scaffolding” of the social environment. Alongside this substantive work, my research develops approaches to measuring personal cultural change over time with applicability to diverse theoretical problems. My research has been published in the <em>American Sociological Review</em> and <em>Sociological Science</em>.

Prior to working at NC State, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Iowa.
